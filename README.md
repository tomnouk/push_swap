# **push_swap**

## **Project overview**
The **push_swap** project is a crucial part of the **42 curriculum**.
It challenges students to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations, with the goal of achieving the smallest possible number of moves.
This project aims to improve understanding of algorithms, data structures, and efficient coding practices in C.

#### **Objective**
- **Sort a Stack**: Implement a sorting algorithm to sort a stack of integers with the fewest moves possible.
- **Use Defined Operations**: Utilize only the allowed operations (`sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`) to sort the stack.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Develop an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of operations.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling for invalid input and edge cases.

#### **Key features**
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Efficient implementation of a sorting algorithm using the defined set of operations.
- **Operation Functions**: Implementation of the allowed operations to manipulate the stack.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation to handle various edge cases and invalid inputs.

#### **Compiling the project
- `make` for the mandatory part (push_swap).

#### **Example Usage**
```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1
```
